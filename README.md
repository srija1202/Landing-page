This project is built with React based on the Bootstrap Landing Plate template (https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-landing-page).

The project has 8 main components :

Nav Bar
Header
Features
Image Showcase of Features
Testimonials
Call To Action
Footer
The Features component renders object found in FeaturesData.json, while the Testimonials renders object based on reviews.json dynamically. More testimonial or features can be added easily by ammending the json file.
